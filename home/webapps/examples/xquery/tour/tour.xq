    <Modified as example XQuery for XSLWeb by Maarten Kroon>

    XQuery program to perform a knight's tour of the chessboard.
    Author: Michael H. Kay
    Date: 26 June 2003
    Modified: 25 Sept 2014
    
    This version modified to use XQuery 3.0, with sequences and functions.

    This query does not use a source document.
    There is an optional parameter, start, which can be set to any square on the
    chessboard, e.g. a3 or h5. By default the tour starts at a1.
    
    There is a second optional parameter, end, which indicates that the processing should stop
    after a given number of steps (the default value is 64). This can be used to animate the 
    display of the tour. This works especially well when the query is compiled into a Java servlet.

    The output is an HTML display of the completed tour.

    Internally, the following data representations are used:
    * A square on the chessboard: represented as a number in the range 0 to 63
    * A state of the chessboard: a sequence of 64 integers, each containing a move number. 
      A square that has not been visited yet is represented by a zero.
    * A set of possible moves: represented as a sequence of integers,
    * each integer representing the number of the destination square
